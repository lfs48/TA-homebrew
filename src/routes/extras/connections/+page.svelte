        <h1>Connection Bonuses</h1>
        <p>
            At your GM's discretion, the following <yellow>Connection Bonuses</yellow>
            may be made available to assign to Relationships at your branch.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Advocate</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                This person is great at finding loopholes
                to get people out of trouble.
                Up to <red>3</red> times during your mission
                when you would receive <red>one Demerit</red>,
                you can explain the context to them
                and ask them to argue in your defense.
                They will provide your GM a compelling reason why
                the <red>Demerit</red> wasn't warranted,
                and you won't receive it. Revealing too much
                information can still create a <b>Loose End</b>.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Benefactor</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                This person has tons of money and likes to spend it on you.
                They give you a high-end credit card you can use on your next mission.
                It can cover any small purchases you make, and one
                obscenely expensive one. People who see you with this card
                will assume you are a big spender and treat you accordingly.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Epicurean</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                This person is an excellent cook.
                They will prepare homemade snacks
                for you to take on your mission,
                enough for <red>3</red> servings.
                Anyone who eats a serving of these snacks
                ignores all <b>Burnout</b> on their next roll.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Forecaster</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                This person hosts a program where they make
                predictions about a specific topic:
                weather, finance, social media trends, etc.
                You can tune in once during your mission
                to catch them giving today's forecast.
                Whatever predictions they make related
                to their subject of expertise will come to pass.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Gaslighter</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                This person loves to lie for fun.
                Once during your mission you can ask them
                to help you convince a group of people
                of something that's blatantly untrue,
                and the targets will believe it. If you do anything later
                to expose or contradict the lie, you lose
                <yellow>one Connection</yellow> with this Relationship.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Paranoid</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                This person lives in constant fear.
                Once during your mission, you can suggest someone
                or something is out to get them. They will
                keep an eye on it from afar for the rest
                of the mission, communicating any major
                developments to you. Should they witness anything
                <blue>Anomalous</blue>, their paranoid nature
                will keep them from spreading that knowledge:
                their <b>Loose End</b> count will not grow
                beyond one while this <b>Bonus</b> is active.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Repulsive</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                No one wants to be near this person.
                Once during your mission, you can ask them
                to approach a mundane person or group of people.
                They target(s) will quickly find an excuse to leave the area
                and won't return until your Relationship is gone.
