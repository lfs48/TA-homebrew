            Research has shown that most employees only achieve 
            <red>30</red>-70% of their potential revenue generation,
            due to psychological barriers such as hesitation, self-doubt, 
            and the stress coefficient of human bones.
            <red>Agency</red> Coaches are tasked with liberating
            their coworkers from these mental blockers 
            to unlock those final few percentage points. 
            They work tirelessly toward the success of others
            by designing training regimens, monitoring performance 
            metrics, and refusing to tolerate anything short of perfection.

            While many Coaches fuffill the role in a 
            traditional sense by managing the physical fitness
            of their team, they also fill a wide variety of other 
            <red>Agency</red> positions.
            Many of our  dieticians, algebra tutors,
            and podcast hosts are recognized as Coaches.
            Whether you're eyeing the gym or conference podium, 
            the Coaching department welcomes anyone
            with the courage to call out mediocrity
            and the will to put those coddled slackers to work.
