            This person is great at finding loopholes
            to get people out of trouble.
            Up to <red>3</red> times during your mission
            when you would receive <red>one Demerit</red>,
            you can explain the context to them
            and ask them to argue in your defense.
            They will provide your GM a compelling reason why
            the <red>Demerit</red> wasn't warranted,
            and you won't receive it. Revealing too much
            information can still create a <b>Loose End</b>.

            This person has tons of money and likes to spend it on you.
            They give you a high-end credit card you can use on your next mission.
            It can cover any small purchases you make, and one
            obscenely expensive one. People who see you with this card
            will assume you are a big spender and treat you accordingly.
