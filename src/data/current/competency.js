        Research has shown that most employees only achieve 
        <red>30</red>-70% of their potential revenue generation,
        due to psychological barriers such as hesitation, self-doubt, 
        and the stress coefficient of human bones.
        <red>Agency</red> Coaches are tasked with liberating
        their coworkers from these mental blockers 
        to unlock those final few percentage points. 
        They work tirelessly toward the success of others
        by designing training regimens, monitoring performance 
        metrics, and refusing to tolerate anything short of perfection.

        While many Coaches fuffill the role in a 
        traditional sense by managing the physical fitness
        of their team, they also fill a wide variety of other 
        <red>Agency</red> positions.
        Many of our  dieticians, algebra tutors,
        and podcast hosts are recognized as Coaches.

        the Coaching department welcomes anyone
        with the courage to call out mediocrity
        and the will to put those coddled slackers to work.

      This little pocket-sized booklet contains a 
      limitless inventory of tautological statements
      and fabricated anecdotes. Once per mission, 
      you can read one off to another person 
      while discussing a mundane task that they 
      normally wouldnâ€™t be able to perform.
      They will succeed at that task whenever they attempt it
      for the rest of the mission, achieving the best possible results.
      Any injury they might  incur while performing that task is 
      deferred until it is completed.
